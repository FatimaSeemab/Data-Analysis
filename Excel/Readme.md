# My Experience and Expertise in Excel

This folder showcases my experience and expertise in Excel through various projects. These projects have helped me develop skills in data cleaning, data visualization, and creating detailed dashboards.

## Data Cleaning

I have gained extensive experience in data cleaning using Excel and Power Query. This includes sorting,filtering, transposing data e.t.c.

## Data Visualization

One of the projects involved visualizing sales data of different stationery items. I created various types of visualizations, such as line and bar graphs, to identify trends in sales of different products over different months.

## Excel Detailed Project (Dashboard)

In a detailed project, I analyzed a bike sales dataset. The dashboard includes:

- **Purchases per Age Range**: Analyzing the number of purchases made by different age groups.
- **Average Income**: Examining the average income of customers.
- **Purchases per Commute Distance**: Investigating purchases based on the distance customers commute.

Additionally, I added slicers to the dashboard to filter and analyze the data based on:

- **Gender Distribution**
- **Education Level**
- **Marital Status**

These slicers help in understanding the impact of these factors on the above charts.
